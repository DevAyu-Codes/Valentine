# Valentine-v1.5-JAVA
Use this code to propose to your girl/boy for Valentine's Day.

This code is written for introverts who cannot directly ask their girl/boy about it. You just have to share the code or modify it and convert it to exe and then share. And as soon as your girl/boy runs it, they cannot exit the program unless they click on "Yes!". Note that they can still exist the program using task manager or alt+f4.

Features:
* Other person cannot exit the program unless the click on "Yes!".
* A chat button and a special gift button (You can change the link) will appear after clicking "Yes!".
* Audio will automatically stop when any button with link is clicked.
* Code is very short and easy to understand.
